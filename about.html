                When I was in grade school, I started my first small business. I would make Halloween decorations out of construction paper and sell them to my 
                classmates for nickels and dimes. There were such greats as "ghost in pumpkin," "ghost and gravestone," and "spider's web with spider." That 
                one was a quarter because it required string. I now have my own Etsy shop and two print on demand stores at Society6 and TeePublic. I love creating art and I hope
                that my art brings you as much joy as it did for me.
